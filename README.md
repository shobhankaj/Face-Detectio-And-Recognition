# Face Recognition Using CNN

Step 1 Run “Face Recognition.ipynb” cell 1

        -- This will take 7100 snaps of the users face and save it in the folder 'dataset'
        
        -- Make sure the camera is open in your laptop or system

Step 2 Run “Face Recognition.ipynb” cell 2, 3, and 4

        -- This will train the CNN model and save the weights as 'trained_model.h5'
        
        -- This will train the model and run the epochs as per your requirement. 


Step 3 Run “Face Recognition.ipynb” cell 5

        -- This will open the webcam instance for face recognition
        
        -- This will detect the Name of the user as well as Display the Accuracy of the probability
